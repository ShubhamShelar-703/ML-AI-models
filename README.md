Resolving Zomato’s Delivery Delays Through Tailored Consulting
Project Summary
This project aims to analyze and resolve delivery delays faced by Zomato, using real data from Kaggle. With Python-driven visualizations and insights, the analysis identifies key patterns and proposes strategic consulting solutions to reduce delivery inefficiencies and enhance customer satisfaction.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle

Contents: Includes features such as delivery time, partner ratings, age, vehicle type, and order type.

Key Exploratory Insights
Average Delivery Time: 26.29 minutes

Delivery Time Spread: From 10 minutes up to nearly 1 hour

Partner Ratings: Generally, partners rated 4–6 deliver faster, but high ratings do not always guarantee quick delivery

Age Factor: Delivery time slightly increases with age

Order Type & Vehicle Type: Minor variance in delivery times across order and vehicle types; scooters and e-scooters are marginally quicker

Strategic Recommendations
Smart Order Allocation
Mark riders as 'busy' while handling an active order to prevent multiple order overload.

Optimized Routing
Implement real-time route optimization algorithms to improve navigation efficiency.

Partner Incentives & Training
Encourage faster deliveries and better ratings through structured rewards and upskilling.

Distance-Based Dish Suggestions
Promote dishes from nearby restaurants based on customer preferences to reduce delivery range and time.

Vehicle Maintenance & Upgrades
Maintain and incentivize the use of efficient delivery vehicles.

Predictive Staffing
Manage peak-hour demand with predictive models and scalable delivery workforce.

Tools Used
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (assumed based on visuals)

Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Any Python IDE

Visualization: Delivery patterns plotted using Python

Conclusion
This consulting case study provides a mix of data-backed operational insights and practical recommendations for Zomato to tackle its delivery delay challenge and improve customer experience. It combines analytics and strategic thinking to offer implementable improvements.
